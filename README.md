# Download-from-YouTube
Web app that turns YouTube URLs into mp4 (video), mp3 (audio) or m4a (uncompressed audio) files on your PC

This web app uses streamlit, subprocess and ffmpeg.

These dependencies will need to be installed. streamlit and ffmpeg will need to be added to path for the scripts to run.
The set up script has been flagged by Windows Defender as a TROJAN attack, but fear not, I am working on a fix (all it does is install dependencies).

Run the exe files as administrator, starting with SETUP.exe and then YOUTUBE-DOWNLOADER.exe
The web app will launch on your default browser if successful.

Depending on your network settings, the web app will also be available on your local network.
All downloads will take place on the computer hosting the app.

#brief: this web app program takes an URL as an imput and downloads a mp3 or mp4 file
#       depending on the user's choice regarding the format.
#       it has to be run on PowerShell using the command
#       streamlit run app.py
#       Make sure no other apps are running on port 8501,
#       otherwise streamlit won't be able to open.
#       A corrupted cache may cause issues.
#       To clear a corrupted cache in the shell, run
#       streamlit cache clear
#       And restart the app with
#       streamlit run app.py
#
